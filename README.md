# boreal-modpack
A Fabric modpack for Java version 1.21.10, made for playing with friends. It includes simple mods focused on optimizing performance and enhancing visuals without straying too far from the vanilla experience.

Since I compiled the .jar files of each mod on the .zip they may not be compatible with some mod managers, and if new versions are released I might not be able to add them immediately, so feel free to check the mods, remove what you don't want or add more!

All credits to the respective mod developers.
